Trying to get into building hybrid mobile appswithout knowing
anything about java script or developing for mobile platforms.

The most important (and only) thing about this app can do is:
* I can swipe!
* I can use a camera

Tools:
* Cloud9-IDE (nice online js ide)
  (Project setup on Cloud9-IDE: run "npm install")
* jQuery mobile (click click layout)
* Phonegap Build (packages code for different platforms).
